# TestRobot2022

## What is this project?
This FIRST Robotics project contains the code for Team 7358's robot for the 2022 FRC competition. It is free to repurpose and modify for yourself, although I'm not sure you would want to.

## What does it do?
Our project folder is labeled TestDrive because we never renamed it; There are three subsystems, the drive train, climber, and intake/shooter system. The drive train operates on an arcadeDrive-esque system and the intake/shooter are controlled using the left and right triggers respectively on the XBox controller we've set up for our driver. The climber uses a spool to wind up / extend a winch (via a constant spring force telescoping arm that propels it upwards).

We have encoders integrated with the Falcon 500s. We're also thinking of using an old gyro, and/or other hardware we would need to use PID control, because our autonomous is pretty jank and barebones. As of the conclusion of the 2022 FRC competition, we have only tested the basic functionality of the robot with little time dedicated to troubleshooting problems we may face at competition besides quick fixes actually performed *at* competition.

## Plans for future iterations of the code
In future years we hope to switch to a swerve drive and use more complex subsystem. For example, we have observed a new type of intake (a rod with spinning brushes that extends from the main body to scoop in balls) which we hope to use in future years for similar games. We're slowly recovering from COVID-19's pernicious effects on education, but it'll be a while before we attempt anything really custom.

## Versions:
1.2.1 - 1.2.5 (deleted branches) - Primarily just driving, starting on the wheel system. Long deprecated and replaced by newer versions

1.2.6.1 (Main) - The version we use for competition, stable enough for consistent use. Still some vestigial files and things we coded because Nolan was bored and didn't want to use libraries...

1.2.7-Experimental (Main) - Changes to control scheme etc. we have not had time to properly test and therefore do not feel comfortable using during upcoming competitions. Includes some stuff for limelight, gyro magics, changes to arcade drive - not really functional

## Contributors:
Nolan Heffner, Emma, Jessica Gay (former), Anthony Pinzon, Spencer, Abdou Senghore, Jabel Senghore, and Micah

Note (5/19/22): Nolan, Abdou, and Jabel are graduating. Emma is leaving the team. Anthony Pinzon and Landon will probably be our primary programmers in the 2023 build season.

You can text Nolan at 678-571-4047 or locate Mrs. Jenkins' email through the Mountain View High School (Lawrenceville, GA) website's staff directory.
Either way, we'd love to collaborate with other FRC teams!
