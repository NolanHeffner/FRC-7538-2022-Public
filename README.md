# TestRobot2022

## What is this project?
This FIRST Robotics project contains the code for Team 7358's robot for the 2022 FRC competition. It is free to repurpose and modify for yourself, although I'm not sure you would want to.

## What does it do?
Our project folder is labelled TestDrive vA.B.C; There are two subsystems, the drive train and our intake/shooter system. The drive train operates on an arcadeDrive-esque system and the intake/shooter are controlled using the left and right triggers respectively on the XBox controller we've set up for our driver.

We don't have the encoders, sensors, gyros, and/or other hardware we would need to use PID control, so our autonomous is pretty jank and barebones. Currently we have not tested anything autonomous-related yet because we're still working on getting the 2022 bot finished - we haven't even tested all TeleOp function yet.

## Plans for future iterations of the code
In future years we hope to incorporate encoders, kinematics, and odometry into our robot hardware and control for greater precision in autonomous mode. We're slowly recovering from COVID-19's pernicious effects on education, but it'll be a while before we attempt anything really advanced.

## Further notes
We're so bored, we've had nothing to do for weeks now, Nolan keeps just adding random potato-code to keep busy... at least people say the robot drives nice

Either way, we'd love to collaborate with other FRC teams!
