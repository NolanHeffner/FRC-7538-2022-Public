# TestRobot2022

## What is this project?
This FIRST Robotics project contains the code for Team 7358's robot for the 2022 FRC competition. It is free to repurpose and modify for yourself, although I'm not sure you would want to. It's in its early stages and is simple as befits our straightforward bot design.

## What does it do?
There are two subsystems, the drive train and our intake/shooter system. The drive train operates on an arcadeDrive-esque system and the intake/shooter are controlled using the right trigger and XYB buttons (three speed options) respectively on the XBox controller we've set up for our driver.
