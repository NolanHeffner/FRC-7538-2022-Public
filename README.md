# TestRobot2022

## What is this project?
This FIRST Robotics project contains the code for Team 7358's robot for the 2022 FRC competition. It is free to repurpose and modify for yourself, although I'm not sure you would want to.

## What does it do?
Our project folder is labelled TestDrive vA.B.C; There are three subsystems, the drive train, climber, and intake/shooter system. The drive train operates on an arcadeDrive-esque system and the intake/shooter are controlled using the left and right triggers respectively on the XBox controller we've set up for our driver. The climber uses a spool to wind up / extend a winch (via a constant spring force telescoping arm that propels it upwards).

We have encoders integrated with the Falcon 500s. We're also thinking of using an old gyro, and/or other hardware we would need to use PID control, because our autonomous is pretty jank and barebones. Currently we have only tested the basic functionality of the robot with little time dedicated to troubleshooting problems we may face at competition.

## Plans for future iterations of the code
In future years we hope to further incorporate encoders, kinematics, and odometry into our robot hardware and control for greater precision in autonomous mode. We're slowly recovering from COVID-19's pernicious effects on education, but it'll be a while before we attempt anything really advanced.

## Versions:
1.2.1 - 1.2.4 (deleted branches) - Primarily just driving, starting on the wheel system. Long deprecated and replaced by newer versions

1.2.5 (Main) - Currently deprecated, still the most stable version

1.2.6 (branch) - The version we use for competition, stable enough for consistent use

1.2.7-Experimental (branch) - Changes to control scheme etc. we have not had time to properly test and therefore do not feel comfortable using during upcoming competitions. Includes limelight, gyro magics, changes to arcade drive
